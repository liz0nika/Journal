# Journal

Write a console program that allows you to create the "Journal Entry" entity.
To do this, you need to:
* organize data entry from the command line and transfer the input result to the corresponding entity;
* check the correctness of the data entry (saving the correctly entered data) and, if all the data is completely correct, transfer it to the corresponding class in the model; if the date is not in the required format, then suggest re-entering it.
* display all journal entries.

The "Journal Entry" entity is described by the following set:
* student's last name;
* student's first name;
* student's birth data;
* student's phone number;
* home address (street, house, apartment).
